    <title> This here is some good HTML learning! </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my first webpage! </p>
    <p> The p tag is for paragraphs! </p>
    <p> Def using this as my notes now. </p>
    <h1> This is the h1 tag. It stands for header. </h1>
    <h2> This is the h2 tag. It stands for subheader! </h2>
    <h3> This is the h3 tag. Guess there are 6 of these. </h3>
    <h4> h4. Oh boy I can't wait to see what this looks like! </h4>
    <h5> h5. Buckle up! </h5>
    <h6> h6. Bingo Bango Bongo I'm so happy in the congo. </h6>
    <h6> Haha h6 is so small! </h6>
    <p> All of those were header tags. Now we're back to the paragraph tag...FOR NOW </p>
    <p> These tags are block elements because it is written on its own line
      and creates a block of content on the displayed page. </p>
    <p> Now for lists! The tag ul is for unordered lists, meaning bullet points. </p>
    <p> The tag ol is for numbered lists, and the tag li is for list items. </p>
    <p> Please nest your li's within your ol or ul tags for easy reading. K THX. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> This is a unordered list. </li>
      <li> Did use ul for this one. </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li> This is an ordered list. </li>
      <li> Still using li for those listy bits though. </li>
      <li> This line SHOULD be numbered 3. We'll see. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> These two are list elements, because reasons. </p>
    <p> Last but not least, gotta let this program know it's an html doc, and how
      it ought to be formatted. </p>
