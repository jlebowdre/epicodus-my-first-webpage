<p> This is my first webpage! </p>
<p> The p tag is for paragraphs! </p>
<p> Def using this as my notes now. </p>
<h1> This is the h1 tag. It stands for header. </h1>
<h2> This is the h2 tag. It stands for subheader! </h2>
<h3> This is the h3 tag. Guess there are 6 of these. </h3>
<h4> h4. Oh boy I can't wait to see what this looks like! </h4>
<h5> h5. Buckle up! </h5>
<h6> h6. Bingo Bango Bongo I'm so happy in the congo. </h6>
<p> All of those were header tags. Now we're back to the paragraph tag...FOR NOW </p>
<p> These tags are block elements because it is written on its own line
  and creates a block of content on the displayed page. </p>
